# Processing-Game

This is my first programming project I did in my first year of studies at Keele University. 
We were asked to develop a simple game using Processing. 
The idea of the game was simple, catch falling objects and progress through the levels. 
Some of the functionalities of the game do not work with the newest releases of processing. 
Looking at it now its really clear to me how ugly the code is. I will update it later on as I feel some sentiment to it.
